I feel like all of my writing could quite easily start off describing the view outside. Itâ€™s usually how I begin; staring off into the deep blue Scottish sky. I prefer to write with a clear head, disconnected from the outside world, where I can think and type in peace.

This evening, like many evenings before, I'm sitting in my favourite spot at home with a small tumbler of deep amber liquid. I appreciate that the whisky I'm drinking will soon remove the "clear head" I prefer to write with, so hopefully I can get my thoughts out within one glass.

This particular glass is my favourite. I acquired it on my 21st birthday, from a bar that no longer exists in Edinburgh. Possibly because people kept taking all their good glasses. The thick, pentagonal base makes a satisfying thud on the thin wood of my coffee table between drinks; you can feel the weight behind it, something I've always felt most glencairns lack, despite their superiority for nosing. I drink whisky to <i>feel</i> it, for the experience it provides. The receptacle you choose is part of that experience.

I, like most people I imagine, was never a big fan of dark spirits during the first few years exploring alcohol.
