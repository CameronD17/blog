                <li>Figuring out the logistics of merging my blog with my main site, and what I want the purpose of each to be.</li>
                <li>Learning AngularJS and React. I have a small project in the works for each.</li>
                <li>Spending as much time as I can with <a href="http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/#charlie">my dog Charlie</a>, whether that's playfighting, training or walks.</li>
                <li>Making sure I stay on track with my self-imposed writing target (<a href="http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk/">3 blog posts per month</a>, going well so far).</li>
                <li>Planning my 2017 travels - so far I'm hoping to at least go to Vancouver/Seattle for a couple of weeks, Prague for a football tournament, and a weekend with friends either in the UK or mainland Europe.</li>
                <li>Berating myself for not running anymore - hoping to fix that in the next couple of weeks.</li>
