# [blog.camerondoyle.co.uk] (http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk)

blogcamerondoyle.co.uk is my personal blog, updated sporadically whenever I remember. It is linked closely to my [main site](http://camerondoyle.co.uk).

The site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the design is based on my main site, developed from the [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) template.
