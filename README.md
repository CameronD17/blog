# [blog.camerondoyle.co.uk] (http://blog.camerondoyle.co.uk)

blog.camerondoyle.co.uk is my personal blog, updated sporadically whenever I remember, although I do try to post at least twice a month. It started life as an offshoot of my [main site](http://camerondoyle.co.uk) although it has been redesigned since then. 

The site is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and built on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
